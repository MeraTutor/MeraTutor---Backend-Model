## Short description 

MeraTutor - AI-powered virtual teacher ensures continuous, personalized learning remotely.

### What's the problem?



The current education system, while robust in many ways, often fails to address the individual learning needs of students. Major challenges include:

  
    
    • Inequitable Access: Students from underserved communities or with disabilities often lack access to tailored resources or support systems that address their specific learning challenges.
These issues collectively contribute to achievement gaps, disengagement, and missed learning opportunities. The challenge is to create a system that delivers personalized learning 		experiences, offers real-time feedback, and promotes inclusivity regardless of students' abilities or backgrounds.

Climate Change : Climate change-induced disasters such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and storms can disrupt education by destroying school infrastructure, displacing communities, or causing temporary school closures. Vulnerable communities are more likely to suffer from the prolonged effects of such events.Environmental disasters and climate-induced displacement can force families to move, interrupting children’s education and often placing them in environments where access to schools is limited or non-existent.

Transportation Barriers: In geographically isolated regions, students may struggle to physically access schools due to long distances, poor roads, or a lack of affordable transportation. Natural disasters exacerbated by climate change, such as floods or landslides, can make school access even more difficult.

  • Lack of Personalized Learning: Many students struggle in traditional learning environments because lessons are not tailored to their pace or style of learning.
    
    • Resource Constraints: Teachers often have large classes and limited time, making it difficult to give personalized attention to each student.
    
    • Assessment Gaps: Traditional assessments do not provide real-time feedback on a student’s understanding and fail to adapt to individual learning needs.
