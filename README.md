## Short description 

**MeraTutor** - AI-powered virtual teacher ensures continuous, personalized learning remotely.

### Problem Statement

The current education system, while robust in many ways, often fails to address the individual learning needs of students. Major challenges include:

* **Inequitable Access**: Students from underserved communities or those with disabilities often don’t get the personalized resources or support they need to help with their learning challenges. This leads to learning gaps and missed opportunities for success.

* **Climate Change** : Natural disasters like floods, droughts, wildfires etc, made worse by climate change disturb education by damaging schools, forcing families to move, and causing temporary school closures. Vulnerable communities are hit the hardest, making it harder for kids to continue their education.

* **Transportation Barriers**: In remote areas, students struggle to reach schools because of long distances, poor roads, or lack of affordable transport. Disasters like floods or landslides make getting to school even harder.

* **Lack of Personalized Learning**: Many students find it difficult to keep up in traditional classrooms because lessons aren’t designed to match their learning pace or style.
    
* **Resource Constraints**: Teachers often have large class sizes and limited time, making it hard to give each student the individual attention they need.
    
* **Assessment Gaps**: Traditional assessments don’t offer immediate feedback on how well a student understands a topic and fail to adapt to individual learning needs.

### How can technology help?

MeraTutor helps students continue learning, even when they can't go to school because of problems like natural disasters, bad weather, or transportation issues. It adjusts lessons to fit each student’s way of learning and how fast they learn, so no one falls behind. If schools are closed or students can’t attend in person, it lets them learn from home or anywhere else. It makes learning fun by using interactive activities, quizzes, and games, and gives instant feedback so students know how they’re doing right away.

It also supports students with special learning needs by giving personalized attention and lessons that are easier to understand. It acts like a tutor, offering assignments, asking questions, and giving helpful feedback to keep students on track. If a student struggles with a topic, the virtual tutor can re-explain it in a simpler way. By providing continuous and tailored learning, MeraTutor make sure students don’t miss out on education, even during difficult situations, and helps them stay motivated and engaged in their studies.

### The idea

**AI-Powered Learning Assistants for Inclusive Education**

To tackle the challenges of personalizing education and making it inclusive for everyone, we propose an AI-powered learning system that acts like a personal tutor for each student. This system includes four smart agents that work together to create a complete learning experience:

* Virtual Tutor: This assistant explains lessons, answers questions, and helps students understand difficult topics. It changes its explanations based on how well each student understands, making sure no one falls behind.
* Quiz Generator: When students feel ready, the AI creates quizzes to test what they’ve learned. These quizzes adjust to focus on the specific topics the student has studied.
* Evaluator & Feedback Agent: After students take a quiz, this agent looks at their answers and gives detailed feedback. It creates a report showing what the student did well and where they need more practice, offering helpful suggestions for improvement.
