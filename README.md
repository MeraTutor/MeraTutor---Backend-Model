## Short description 

MeraTutor - AI-powered virtual teacher ensures continuous, personalized learning remotely.

### Problem Statement

The current education system, while robust in many ways, often fails to address the individual learning needs of students. Major challenges include:

* **Inequitable Access**: Students from underserved communities or those with disabilities often don’t get the personalized resources or support they need to help with their learning challenges. This leads to learning gaps and missed opportunities for success.

* **Climate Change** : Natural disasters like floods, droughts, wildfires etc, made worse by climate change disturb education by damaging schools, forcing families to move, and causing temporary school closures. Vulnerable communities are hit the hardest, making it harder for kids to continue their education.

* **Transportation Barriers**: In remote areas, students struggle to reach schools because of long distances, poor roads, or lack of affordable transport. Disasters like floods or landslides make getting to school even harder.

* **Lack of Personalized Learning**: Many students find it difficult to keep up in traditional classrooms because lessons aren’t designed to match their learning pace or style.
    
* **Resource Constraints**: Teachers often have large class sizes and limited time, making it hard to give each student the individual attention they need.
    
* **Assessment Gaps**: Traditional assessments don’t offer immediate feedback on how well a student understands a topic and fail to adapt to individual learning needs.
